# 3D Plots

Look at the pretty pictures!

## Dataset
Data is generated from a function and then perturbed randomly using a function, and then perturbed randomly using a normal distribution.

### Generating Function as a Wireframe

## Least-Squares Approximations

## Linear Regression
Only 3 training points are used for the linear regression for this example, specifically to get a poorly-trained model for demonstration. 
Even so, with these three particular points, the approximation is actually pretty good.
