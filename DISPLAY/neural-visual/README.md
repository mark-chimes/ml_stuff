## Sample Weights

Higher is bigger absolute value - i.e., more of a contribution to the neuron. Where the weights were negative, I inverted the colours, so what you see 
below is the actual contribution. 

It is only possible to visualize one neuron's weights at a time. I pick out the most contributing neuron to the last layer and work backwards.
